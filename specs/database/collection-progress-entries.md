# Database Collection: `progress_entries`

This collection is fundamental to the COCKMAXXING platform, serving as the secure and private repository for each user's individual progress logs. It stores all the detailed data related to their penis enlargement journey, including measurements, routine descriptions, personal notes, and references to private photos. The design prioritizes data integrity, user privacy, and efficient retrieval for progress visualization. Each document within this collection represents a single logged entry for a specific date by a particular user.

## Fields:

-   **`id`** (string, required): A unique identifier for each progress entry. This will typically be a UUID generated by the client or server upon creation.

-   **`user_id`** (reference, required): A foreign key referencing the `id` field in the `users` collection. This establishes ownership of the progress entry, ensuring that each entry is linked to a specific user.

-   **`date`** (date, required): The specific calendar date for which this progress entry is logged. This is crucial for chronological tracking and chart generation. Format should be ISO 8601 (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`).

-   **`measurements`** (object, required): An embedded object containing detailed quantitative measurement data. This includes:
    -   `length_flaccid` (number): Flaccid length, in the specified `unit`.
    -   `length_erect` (number): Erect length, in the specified `unit`.
    -   `girth_midshaft` (number): Mid-shaft girth, in the specified `unit`.
    -   `girth_base` (number): Base girth, in the specified `unit`.
    -   `unit` (enum: 'in' | 'cm'): The unit of measurement used for all values in this entry.

-   **`routine_details`** (richtext, optional): A text field to describe the specific enlargement exercises, techniques, or routine performed on this day. Supports rich text formatting for clarity.

-   **`notes`** (richtext, optional): A private text field for the user's personal observations, mood, challenges, or any other private remarks related to the day's entry. Supports rich text formatting.

-   **`private_photo_urls`** (array of URLs, optional): An array of URLs pointing to securely stored private photos associated with this entry. These URLs will link to Firebase Storage and are only accessible to the `user_id` owner.

-   **`created_at`** (date, required): A timestamp indicating when this progress entry was first created in the database. Format should be ISO 8601 (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`).

## Relationships:

-   **`references users via user_id`**: Each `progress_entry` document is directly linked to one `user` document, establishing a one-to-many relationship where one user can have many progress entries.
