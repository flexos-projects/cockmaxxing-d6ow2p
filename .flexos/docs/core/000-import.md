# COCKMAXXING: Project Overview

COCKMAXXING is envisioned as a community-driven platform dedicated to supporting individuals on their penis enlargement journeys. It addresses a significant problem: the widespread lack of reliable information, supportive communities, and safe practices in this sensitive area. The internet is often a source of misinformation and dangerous methods, leaving individuals confused and vulnerable. Our solution is to provide a moderated, evidence-based, and privacy-focused environment where members can safely share experiences, track progress, and access vetted resources.

## Core Concept:

-   **Problem:** Difficulty finding reliable information and support for penis enlargement, leading to misinformation and potential harm.
-   **Solution:** A moderated, evidence-based community with progress tracking, curated resources, and expert engagement.
-   **Target User:** Men aged 25-55, seeking self-improvement, data-driven approaches, peer support, and privacy in their enlargement journey.
-   **Unique Value:** Combines peer support with expert-reviewed resources and robust private progress tracking, all within a non-judgmental, privacy-focused community.

## Key Features:

The platform's core functionalities include **Community Forums** for discussion, **Progress Tracking & Journaling** for personal data management, a **Curated Resource Library** for vetted information, **Private Messaging** for discreet communication, and secure **User Authentication & Profiles** with **Personalized Settings**.

## Main Pages & User Flows:

Users will interact with a **Landing Page**, **Login/Signup** authentication, a personalized **Dashboard**, dedicated **Community Forums**, a detailed **Progress Tracker**, a **Resource Library**, **Private Messages**, and a **Settings** page. Key user flows include **New User Signup & Onboarding**, **Logging Daily Progress**, and **Participating in Forum Discussions**.

## Data & Technology:

Data is structured around collections such as `users`, `posts`, `comments`, `progress_entries`, and `resources`. The technical stack leverages **Nuxt 4 (Vue 3)** for the frontend, **Firebase Firestore** for the database, **Firebase Authentication** for user management, and **Firebase Hosting** for deployment. The design emphasizes a modern, clean, and empowering aesthetic with a focus on trust and support.
